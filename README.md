# org-autoclock

Automatically clock in to Org mode when you work on a project.

Currently, this clocks in when you work on C files and clocks out when you work on anything else.

# Installation

Put `org-autoclock.el` somewhere in your load-path and add this to your `.emacs`:

```elisp
(require 'org-autoclock)
```

# Start automatic clocking

First, clock in to the Org-mode task you want. This will be the task that is automatically clocked in and out of.

Then,

	M-x org-autoclock-start

# Stop automatic clocking

	M-x org-autoclock-stop
